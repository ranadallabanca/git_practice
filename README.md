# GIT TIPS

- git status: show current status of repo
- git add: add files to be commited
- git commit -m 'a message here': commit changes with a meaningful message.


# Basic workflow

- try to break up the problems into simpler problems (maybe even do this on paper,
  - or comments in code, or rubber ducky method (explain it outloud) )
- code one of these broken up parts
- test and make sure that that chunk is complete
- git add (files that you changed related to that chunk of work)
- git commit -m 'message describes that chunk of work'
- repeat

- later we'll talk github
